To install and run

```
yarn
yarn start
```

We don't have lint-staged, or any other method to enforce styling as a pre-commit hook (lint-staged does not work well without it being setup in root dir), so you might want to setup prettier/eslint in your editor of choice (or run the fix script before submitting PR).
